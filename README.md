# Luvit flutter test
This is the technical flutter test for the assessment given.
I used (Model View Provider) MVP architecture on this which is scalable.
The scalability is evident in that the folder structure of this application is arranged in a way that
each feature has its own folder with views,models,components and its independent provider hence making it easier to disable one feature
or add another one simultaneously.
The complete feature here is homepage and the navigation features as required by the assessment
